Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

Context: To test the code, I used the images Dog_01.jpg (a picture of a golden retriever), Dog_02.jpg (a picture of the same dog but mirrored), Cup_01.jpg (object image) and Snake_01.jpg (a non-dog animal).


1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.


Answer: AlexNet classified it as "golden retriever", while ResNet and VGG classified it as "labrador retriever".


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three model architectures classified it as "labrador retriever". The results for ResNet and VGG remained consistent, but changed for AlexNet.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three models correctly classified these images as non dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Although both ResNet and VGG displayed consistency even with mirrored images, ResNet's output statistics suggested better accuracy and performance, albeit marginal.
